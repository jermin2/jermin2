### Songbook
The third iteration!

Frontend written in ReactJS, backend in Python. Displays songs with chords in their right places. Contains a parser so you can take a list of songs and format it into a booklet. You can test it using the credentials: 
- username: `test`
- password: `testpassword`

### Verse Viewer
